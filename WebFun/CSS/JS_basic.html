                  Cross-platform development with JavaScript. The advantages of cross-platform development are clear: you can write one application and run it on several platforms. Instead of having several applications in various languages, you are able to save a lot of code and expense.</p>
                  <ul>
                      <li><span class= "special">Hey</span> means that the JavaScript code is run on the client machine, which is the browser. Server-side JavaScript means that the code is run on the server which is serving web pages.</li>
                      <li><span class= "special">hey</span> One runs in the browser (client side), the other runs on the server.</li>
                      <li><span class= "special">hey</span>Refers to the capability of software or hardware to run identically on different platforms. Many applications for Windows and the Macintosh, for example, now produce binary-compatible files, which means that users can switch from one platform to the other without converting their data to a new format.</li>
                      <li><span class= "special">hey</span>Yes, JavaScript can be used to develop mobile apps. There are various framework that use JavaScript to build Android and iOS App. The most popular are: Ionic and React Native. For more details you can read the below answer.</li>
                      <li><span class= "special">hey</span>JavaScript used to be very slow. ... This makes JavaScript the fastest dynamic language out there. Actually, server-side JavaScript has gained lot of attention because of its performance.</li>
                      <li><span class= "special">hey</span>To put things simply, JavaScript is an object orient programming language designed to make web development easier and more attractive.</li>
